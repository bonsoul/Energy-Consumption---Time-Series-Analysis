Energy Consumption Time Series Analysis
Overview

This project focuses on predicting hourly energy consumption using historical data and advanced machine learning techniques. Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed a strong seasonal pattern in energy consumption, characterized by increased usage during weekdays and peak hours.
Model Definition

We developed a predictive model for energy consumption, evaluating its performance with key metrics:

    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 3741.57
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2950.23

The model demonstrated effective prediction capabilities under normal conditions. However, to further enhance accuracy, integrating additional weather variables is recommended.
Future Work

Future enhancements could include:

    Incorporating weather data to refine predictions.
    Exploring ensemble methods to improve model performance and robustness.
